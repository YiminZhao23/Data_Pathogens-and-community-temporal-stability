General information

1. Title of Dataset: Fungal pathogens increase community temporal stability primarily through species asynchrony regardless of nutrient fertilization

2. Date of data collection: from 2017-August to 2021-August

3. Geographic location of data collection: Haibei Alpine Meadow Ecosystem Research Station of Northwest Institute of Plateau Biology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, in Menyuan County, Qinghai Province, People's Republic of China (101° 19’E, 37° 36’ N; 3215 m above sea level)

4. Information about funding sources that supported the collection of the data: National Natural Science Foundation of China (Grants No. 31830009), and the Fundamental Research Funds in Hainan University (KYQD (ZR) -20081).

5. Variable List

    Plot: the identity of each plot
    Block: the identity of each block
    Pathogen_exclusion: four levels (control, fungal pathogen exclusion, oomycete pathogen exclusion, and both fungal and oomycete pathogen exclusion)
    Nutrient_fertilization: four levels (control, nitrogen addition, phosphorus addition, and nitrogen and phosphorus addition)
    Mean_SR: mean value of community species richness from 2017 to 2021
    Mean_Biomass: mean value of community biomass from 2017 to 2021
    SD_Biomass: standard deviation of community biomass from 2017 to 2021
    Stability: community temporal stability
    Species_Asychrony: asynchrony among species in a plot
    Species_Stability: mean stability of each species weighted by the species relative abundance in a plot
